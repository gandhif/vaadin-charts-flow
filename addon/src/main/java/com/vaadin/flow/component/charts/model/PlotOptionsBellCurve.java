/**
 * A bell curve is an areaspline series which represents the probability density
 * function of the normal distribution. It calculates mean and standard
 * deviation of the base series data and plots the curve according to the
 * calculated parameters.
 * 
 * Configuration options for the series are given in three levels: 1. Options
 * for all series in a chart are defined in the
 * [plotOptions.series](plotOptions.series) object. 2. Options for all
 * `bellcurve` series are defined in
 * [plotOptions.bellcurve](plotOptions.bellcurve). 3. Options for one single
 * series are given in [the series instance array](series.bellcurve).
